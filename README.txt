Note: I am a Machine Learning person hoping to get a task related to ML/AI but unfortunately I got 
      a API Development Task. Since i have no knowledge of API Development , I Have studied and try
      to build a small Web API using Flask And Python.


Solution:
I have used flask to build a simple API that connects with two Databases: emp_database.db(for employees data) and stk_database.db(for stock data).
Various HTML files used are provided in the template folder.
